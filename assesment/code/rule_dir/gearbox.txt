gearbox rulebase

Rule 1 If the RPM is critical then change_gear is up
Rule 2 If the RPM is high and throttle is middle and profile is smooth then change_gear is up
Rule 3 If the RPM is medium and throttle is low and profile is sharp then change_gear is up
Rule 4 If the RPM is low and throttle is low then change_gear is down
Rule 5 If the RPM is medium and throttle is low and profile is sharp then change_gear is down
Rule 6 If the RPM is medium and throttle is floor then change_gear is down
Rule 7 If the RPM is medium and throttle is low and profile is sharp then change_gear is down
Rule 8 If the RPM is high and throttle is low and profile is smooth then change_gear is up
Rule 9 If the RPM is high and throttle is low and profile is sharp then change_gear is no_change
Rule 10 If the RPM is high and throttle is floor then change_gear is no_change
Rule 11 If the RPM is medium and throttle is middle then change_gear is up
Rule 12 If the RPM is high and throttle is middle then change_gear is up
